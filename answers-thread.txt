Q1. Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? 
A1. There are two section would have missing key issue from access conflict with 2 threads
(1). Search key in thread 1, but thread 2 add key immediately
```
// is the key already present?
  struct entry *e = 0;
  for (e = table[i]; e != 0; e = e->next) {
    if (e->key == key)
      break;
  }
```
(2). Update the key, but thread 1/2 insert the same time
```
if(e){
    // update the existing key.
    e->value = value;
  } else {
    // the new is new.
    insert(key, value, &table[i], table[i]);
  }
```
Extra-Note: Gain consistancy result on updating action gain the best performance.
```
// the new is new.
pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);       // acquire lock
insert(key, value, &table[i], table[i]);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);     // release lock
```
